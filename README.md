# DSA2040A ETL Midterm Project - Queen_897

## Project Overview
This project implements an ETL pipeline for sales data as part of the DSA 2040 A US 2025 Mid Semester Exam. It processes `raw_data.csv` (100 rows) and `incremental_data.csv` (10 rows), applies transformations, and loads the results into SQLite databases.

## ETL Phases
1. **Extract (`etl_extract.ipynb`)**
   - Loads and inspects `raw_data.csv` and `incremental_data.csv`.
   - Converts quantity and unit_price to numeric.
   - Displays `.head()` and `.info()`.
   - Notes missing values, duplicates (order_id=4), and string order_date.
   - Saves raw data to `data/` folder.

2. **Transform (`etl_transform.ipynb`)**
   - Applies 4 transformations:
     - Fills missing customer_name and region with 'Unknown', quantity with median, unit_price with mean, order_date with 'Unknown'.
     - Removes duplicate row (order_id=4 in raw_data).
     - Adds total_price column (quantity * unit_price).
     - Converts order_date to datetime (invalid dates become NaT).
   - Includes bonus visualization: bar chart of total sales by product.
   - Saves results to `data/transformed/transformed_full.csv` and `transformed_incremental.csv`.

3. **Load (`etl_load.ipynb`)**
   - Loads transformed data into SQLite databases (`full_data.db`, `incremental_data.db`).
   - Verifies with SQL queries (`SELECT * FROM <table> LIMIT 5`).

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite (via `sqlite3`)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <your-repo-url>`
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas sqlite3 matplotlib`
3. Run notebooks in order:
   - `etl_extract.ipynb`
   - `etl_transform.ipynb`
   - `etl_load.ipynb`
4. Check outputs in `data/transformed/` and `loaded/` folders.

The bar chart visually summarizes the total sales revenue (in dollars) for each product category in the raw_data.csv dataset (100 rows). It uses the total_price (calculated as quantity * unit_price) aggregated by the product column (e.g., 'Tablet', 'Laptop', 'Monitor', 'Phone'). The x-axis lists the product types, while the y-axis shows the total sales in dollars. Each barâ€™s height represents the cumulative revenue for that product, with taller bars indicating higher sales. This helps identify which products are the most and least profitable based on the transformed raw data, after handling missing values (filled with median for quantity, mean for unit_price), removing duplicates, and calculating total_price. The chart serves as a bonus visualization, offering a quick insight into sales trends for business decision-making.
